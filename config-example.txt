mainTime=0     # main time in seconds (default 0) [integer]

periodTime=2   # seconds per period = seconds per move when periodCount=1

periodCount=1  # number of stones for Canadian (default 1); or
               # number of periods for Japanese byo yomi (default 1) [integer]

timeSys=2      # time system (default 2)
               # 0 = none; 1 = abs. time; 2 = Canadian; 3 = Japanese byo yomi
               # 3 requires engine support (GTP command kgs-time_settings) but
               # is the same as 2 for periodCount = 1, so 2 is the default.

timeTolerance=0 # time tolerance in seconds [microsecond precision]
               # for logging time violations or losing the game by time
               # (if enforceTime=1). (default 0)

               # by dumbarb. Engines will still receive time settings at game
               # start but will not receive the "time_left" command before each
               # move and dumbarb will neither log violations nor make engines
               # lose by time.

enforceTime=1  # 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled (default 0)
               # Enables enforcing of time controls (losing by time) with
               # the specified timeTolerance. If disabled, the game
               # continues as normal until one side resigns, but each time
               # violation is logged. This probably works well only with:
               # - Japanese byo yomi, as dumbarb will pretend the engine has
               #   1 byo yomi period left before requesting it to play
               # - Canadian byo yomi with 1 stone per period (periodCount=1),
               #   as the period time is reset after every move anyway.
               # in the other cases, the engine will see it has 0 time left
               # and probably produce bad moves or misbehave.

initialWait=.5 # wait this number of seconds after starting engines
               # (default .5) [can be a fraction].

moveWait=0     # wait this number of seconds before asking each engine

consecutivePasses=2 # consecutive passes needed to end the game (default 2)

# ********************************* Scorer *************************************

# scorer (if set) is the engine used to score the game when the specified con-
# secutive number of passes have occured. It can be set to either:

# - the name, in square brackets, of one of the competing engines, like this:
# scorer=[LZ-2]

# - the command line for a separate engine that will be asked to score the game:
# scorer=leelaz -g -q -w 85c6.txt

# Optional working directory, if scorer is set to a command line.
# scorerWkDir=C:\Users\Stan\Downloads\leela-zero-0.13-win64

# NOTE: If no scorer is set, dumbarb may output 'None' for the result (and cre-
# ate SGF files with "unknown result"). This can be prevented by having the en-
# gines resign, e.g. when they are 99% sure of losing.
