################################## MATCHES ##################################
# Match sections contain at least one space in the [section name]
# Format: [engine-name engine-name label]
#
# The label must be unique for a given pair and order. It can be omitted but,
# as section names are unique, you will not be able to define another match
# with the same players (in that order).

[$Test Inactive]   # to inactivate a whole section, make its name begin with $

# These are default match parameters. (Though engine params can also be added.)

[DEFAULT]

numGames=100
disableSgf=no # 'yes' to skip SGF files

### Extra settings
timeTolerance=0.000000 # set to -1 to disable time-checking altogether
                       # A positive value is most useful for X seconds per move
                       # games. It will be added as extra free time before
                       # ruling a violation. It will not change much
                       # with absolute time / multi-stone Canadian periods as
                       # the tolerance will be added only at the very end.
enforceTime=on # off: games continue but dumbarb logs each subsequent violation
matchWait=0.0  # seconds to wait before each match
gameWait=0.5   # -as above- each game (useful to sync per-game stderr logging; a
