################################## MATCHES ##################################
# Match sections contain at least one space in the [section name]
# Format: [engine-name engine-name label]
# The label must be unique for a given pair and order.

[Randy LZero slowTest]
scorer=AQ      # (optional) engine to score games (can be a third engine)

quiet=yes      # disable on-screen stderr from engines (but also gets overriden)

# Directories Randy_LZero_slowTest and Randy_LZero_fast5sec will be created
# to store results, SGFs, stderr logs, etc. (-001, -002 will be added to the
# name if the target directory already exists.)

################################## ENGINES ##################################
# Engine sections contain no spaces in the [sectionName]

[Randy]
wkDir=C:\path\to\Randy
cmd=python dumbutil.py -R -p 10
logStdErr=no
quiet=no

[LZero]
wkDir=C:\path\to\LeelaZero # wkDir should contain leelaz_opencl_tuning
cmd=leelaz --noponder -w weights.txt -g
quiet=no     # 'yes' = disable stderr on screen (but still log to game files)

[AQ]
wkDir=C:\path\to\AQ
cmd=AQ.exe     # will run in wkDir, where it expects its config file


################################## DEFAULTS ##################################
# These are default match parameters. (Though engine params can also be added.)
# It's also possible to entirely omit any of these from the config, and
# get sane defaults (boardsize 19, komi 7.5, consecutivePasses 2, etc.)

[DEFAULT]

numGames=100
disableSgf=no # 'yes' to skip SGF files
logStdErr=yes # 'no' to skip stderr logging (usable in match AND engine sects)
quiet=no      # 'yes' to suppress on-screen stderr (ok in match/engine sects)
#scorer=...   # default scorer

boardSize=19
komi=7.5
mainTime=0     # seconds
periodTime=2   # seconds
periodCount=1  # stones for Canadian / number of periods for Japanese byo yomi
timeSys=2      # 0 none, 1 absolute, 2 Canadian, 3 Japanese byo yomi

### Extra settings
timeTolerance=0.000000 # set to -1 to disable time-checking altogether
                       # A positive value is most useful for X seconds per move
                       # games. It will be added as extra free time before
                       # ruling a violation. It will not change much
                       # with absolute time / multi-stone Canadian periods as
                       # the tolerance will be added only at the very end.
enforceTime=on # off: games continue but dumbarb logs each subsequent violation
matchWait=0.0  # seconds to wait before each match
gameWait=0.5   # -as above- each game (useful to sync per-game stderr logging; a
               #                       fraction of a second is all it takes)
moveWait=0.0   # -as above- each move
consecutivePasses=2 # finish/score game after this number of passes
