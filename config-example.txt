################################## MATCHES ##################################
# Match sections contain at least one space in the [section name]
# Format: [engine-name engine-name label]
#
# The label must be unique for a given engine pair (strictly: tuple). It can
# be omitted, but section names need to be unique, so you will need labels
# to define multiple matches for the same engines.

[Randy LZero slowTest]
Scorer=AQ      # (optional) engine to score games (can be a third engine)
MainTime=600
PeriodTime=5
PeriodCount=3
TimeSys=3      # Japanese byo yomi

[Randy LZero fast5sec]
NumGames=500
PeriodCount=1
PeriodTime=5
DisableSgf=yes
LogStdErr=no   # gets overridden if the engine section has a different value
Quiet=yes      # disable on-screen stderr from engines (but also gets overriden)

[AQ Randy]     # you can leave match sections empty or nearly empty and set all
               # parameters in [DEFAULTS]

[$Test Inactive]   # to inactivate a whole section, make its name begin with $

# Directories Randy_LZero_slowTest and Randy_LZero_fast5sec will be created
# to store results, SGFs, stderr logs, etc. (-001, -002 will be added to the
# name if the target directory already exists.)

################################## ENGINES ##################################
# Engine sections contain no spaces in the [sectionName]

[Randy]
WkDir=C:\path\to\Randy
Cmd=python dumbutil.py -R -p 10

# dumbarb can also interpolate some settings into the command string
# {matchdir} -- match directory (useful for saving log files there)
#     {name} -- engine name (useful for naming log files}
# {boardsize}, {komi}, {maintime}, {periodtime}, {periodcount}, {timesys}
# see LZero example cmd below

[LZero]
WkDir=C:\path\to\LeelaZero # wkDir should contain leelaz_opencl_tuning
Cmd=leelaz --noponder -w weights.txt -g -l {matchdir}\{name}.log
Quiet=no      # 'yes' = disable stderr on screen (but still log to files)
LogStdErr=yes # yes is default

[AQ]
WkDir=C:\path\to\AQ
Cmd=AQ.exe     # will run in wkDir, where it expects its config file

# Custom commands can also be added to each engine:
# [ExampleEngine]
# WkDir=...
# Cmd=...
# PreGame=gtp_command1
#         gtp_command2 arg1 arg2
# PostGame=...
# PreMatch=...
# PostMatch=...

################################## DEFAULTS ##################################
# These are default match parameters. (Though engine params can also be added.)
# It's also possible to entirely omit any of these from the config, and
# get sane defaults (boardsize 19, komi 7.5, consecutivePasses 2, etc.)

[DEFAULT]

NumGames=100
DisableSgf=no # 'yes' to skip SGF files
LogStdErr=yes # 'no' to skip stderr logging (usable in match AND engine sects)
Quiet=no      # 'yes' to suppress on-screen stderr (ok in match/engine sects)
#scorer=...   # default scorer

BoardSize=19
Komi=7.5
MainTime=0     # seconds
PeriodTime=2   # seconds
PeriodCount=1  # stones for Canadian / number of periods for Japanese byo yomi
TimeSys=2      # 0 none, 1 absolute, 2 Canadian, 3 Japanese byo yomi

### Extra settings
TimeTolerance=0.000000 # set to -1 to disable time-checking altogether
                       # A positive value is most useful for X seconds per move
                       # games. It will be added as extra free time before
                       # ruling a violation. It will not change much
                       # with absolute time / multi-stone Canadian periods as
                       # the tolerance will be added only at the very end.
EnforceTime=on # off: games continue but dumbarb logs each subsequent violation
MatchWait=0.0  # seconds to wait before each match
GameWait=0.5   # -as above- each game (useful to sync per-game stderr logging; a
               #                       fraction of a second is all it takes)
MoveWait=0.0   # -as above- each move
ConsecutivePasses=2 # finish/score game after this number of passes

### GTP timeout: when to start restarting/killing processes
GtpTimeout = 3              # default GTP timeout before terminating process
GtpScorerTO = 4             # final_score timeout for scorer
GtpGenmoveExtra = 15        # extra seconds (in addition to clock time)
GtpGenmoveUntimedTO = 90    # timeout when playing with no time controls
